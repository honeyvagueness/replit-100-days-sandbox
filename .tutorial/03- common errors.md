## Syntax Error

ðŸ‘‰ What is wrong the code below? 

```python
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")

if username == "mark":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
else:
  print("Go away!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
  ```
<details> <summary>ðŸ‘€ Answer </summary> 

The `elif` statement is in the wrong place. It **must** go in between the if and else statements.

```python
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("Username > ")

if username == "mark":
  print("Welcome Mark!")
elif username == "suzanne":
  print("Hey there Suzanne!")
else:
  print("Go away!")
  ```
</details>
